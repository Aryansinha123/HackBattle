Got it ✅ Aryan! Let’s build a **phase-wise, module-wise roadmap** for **SkillUp Intern – Active Learning for Internship Readiness**.

I’ll break it down into **phases** (milestones) and **modules** (functional components in each phase).

---

# 🚀 SkillUp Intern Roadmap

---

## **Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Week 1–2)**

**Goal:** Establish core structure, tech stack, and basic user flow.

**Modules:**

1. **Project Setup**

   * Tech stack selection (Next.js, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, JWT/Auth system).
   * GitHub repo, CI/CD setup.

2. **Authentication System**

   * Student login/registration.
   * Profile creation with basic details (name, domain of interest, current skills).
   * Admin login for posting internships.

3. **Database Models**

   * User (Student, Admin).
   * Internship (Company, Title, Skills required).
   * Skills (list of structured skills).

---

## **Phase 2: Internship Discovery & Skill Profiling (Week 3–4)**

**Goal:** Build internship search and student skill profile system.

**Modules:**

1. **Internship Search**

   * Filter internships by domain, company, or skills.
   * Internship detail page with required skills.

2. **Student Skill Profile**

   * Students manually input known skills.
   * Option to upload resume → auto-extract skills (later phase).

3. **Skill Gap Analyzer (Basic)**

   * Compare student profile with internship requirements.
   * Highlight missing skills in dashboard.

---

## **Phase 3: Active Learning (Week 5–7)**

**Goal:** Provide learning paths for missing skills with interactivity.

**Modules:**

1. **Learning Path Generator**

   * For each missing skill → structured path (Basics → Quizzes → Projects).
   * Store progress in DB.

2. **Quizzes & Practice Sets**

   * Skill-based quizzes (MCQs, coding exercises).
   * Timed challenges.

3. **Mini Projects**

   * Small domain-specific projects (e.g., SQL query tasks, Python scripts).
   * Auto-evaluation for some skills (like coding).

---

## **Phase 4: Gamification & Progress Tracking (Week 8–9)**

**Goal:** Boost engagement and motivation.

**Modules:**

1. **Gamification Layer**

   * Points for quiz/project completion.
   * Badges for milestones (e.g., “SQL Beginner”, “Python Pro”).

2. **Progress Dashboard**

   * Graphs showing completed modules.
   * Skill mastery percentage.

---

## **Phase 5: Predictive Internship Fit & Recommendations (Week 10–12)**

**Goal:** Use data to guide students to right internships.

**Modules:**

1. **Predictive Fit Algorithm**

   * Based on quizzes, projects completed → calculate readiness score.
   * Show percentage fit for each internship.

2. **Internship Recommendations**

   * Suggest internships where student has high readiness.
   * Suggest next skill to learn for desired internship.

---

## **Phase 6: Advanced Features & Expansion (Week 13–14)**

**Goal:** Add intelligent features and polish the platform.

**Modules:**

1. **Resume Parser (AI/NLP Integration)**

   * Auto-detect skills from uploaded resumes.

2. **Analytics for Admins**

   * Which skills are most in demand.
   * Student performance insights.

3. **Community & Collaboration**

   * Peer-to-peer discussions.
   * Group challenges/contests.

---

# 📊 Final Deliverable

By end of **14 weeks**, the platform will have:
✅ Internship Search & Skill Gap Analyzer
✅ Personalized Learning Paths (Quizzes + Projects)
✅ Gamified Progress & Dashboard
✅ Predictive Internship Fit & Recommendations
✅ Admin Analytics & Resume Parser

Do you want me to also **map technologies for each module** (like Next.js pages, APIs, MongoDB schemas, etc.) so it looks like a **developer-ready breakdown**?
